#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

#Rank the items in the superstore by price.
SELECT price, item_name
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#What's the total cost of all items in the superstore?
SELECT sum(price)
FROM superstore
ORDER BY sum(price);

#What's the average price of items in the superstore?
SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#What's the most expensive item?
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore;

#What's the least expensive item?
SELECT MIN(price)
FROM superstore;

#How many items are there in the store?
SELECT COUNT(price)
FROM superstore;

#What's the average price of each item in the Kitchen Supplies category?
SELECT avg(price), item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY avg(price)desc;

#What's the total price of all items combined in the Kitchen Supplies category? 
SELECT sum(price), item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY sum(price) desc;

#What's the total inventory of all items combined in the Kitchen Supplies category? 
SELECT sum(stock_quantity), item_name
FROM superstore

GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY sum(stock_quantity)desc;
