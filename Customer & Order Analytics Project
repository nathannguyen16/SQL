#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE length(cust.order_id) = 6
AND cust.order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what as the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for reach product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), Quantity*Price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) AS Total_Customers, AVG(Price*Quantity) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN customers CUST
ON CUST.order_id = FEB.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
