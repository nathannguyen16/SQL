# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using SQL to answer these 8 questions.

#1. Which 5 artists have the highest average popularity and what are their hottest songs?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) desc
LIMIT 5;

#2. What’s the average danceability of the songs in the Top 50?

SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3. What are the top 10 songs with the loudest music and who’s it by?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY loudness desc
LIMIT 10;

#4. I want something to dance to, what songs have the most energy and the highest danceability? Give me the top 15.

SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE danceability > .68
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 15;

#5.Which songs are “in” right now? Give me a list of the top 10. 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#6. What’s a more chill song? Less lyrics, more instrumental, less tempo

SELECT track_name, artist_name, min(speechiness), max(instrumentalness), min(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY instrumentalness
ORDER BY max(instrumentalness) desc
LIMIT 5;

#7. Which artist sings “Good Days”?

SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
HAVING track_name like '%Good Days%';

#8. What are the 5 least popular songs and who are they by?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY popularity
ORDER BY popularity asc
LIMIT 5;
